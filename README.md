# Basic-Portfolio - Juan Carlos Salas
Basic Portfolio Assignment from Homework #1

My Basic Portfolio assignment using the specifications given to us in Gitlab, but changing the images in the Portfolio sections since the images used in the example were more difficult to find.

The coding for the Heading is the same through all three pages, and include an effect on the links to the left when hovered upon.

The About Me section has an image of myself wrapped with brief information of my career history and interests. Within the content I embedded links to open to new windows and also change appearance when hovering over and activating each link.

In the Portfolio section, as I mentioned before, I used different images than the example but used the same titles since I'm not certain whether there will be a future purpose to those sections. Even though my initial intention was to use a table to arrange the images, I learned in the Thursday Aug 23 class that tables are only meant to be used for data. Therefore, upon doing some research, I revised my code to use a series of divs to get the same effect.

Lastly, the Contact page has the three input boxes inside a form tag. As the example showed, I have placeholder content in the "Name" and "Email" fields. I have also added a submit button, but decided to soften the look by adding a small radius to the edges, as well adding a hover and active effect - hovering over the button adds a shadow, and activating it changes it's vertical orientation giving the illusion the button is really being pressed.

BONUS:
For the three bonuses mentioned in the assignment, I stylized links in both the header and About Me sections. I chose different link colores based on the Adoble Kuler page that was mentioned, and I added a Sticky Footer in all three pages.
